# XRPL
XRPL Project v0.1

1. Enable Anifie users to buy NFTâ€™s and use them in the game.

2. Allows users to upload NFT content to an Anifie.

3. Create an Anifie marketplace.

4. Use XRP Wallet.
 - Multiple people can control/own a single asset via MultiSign
 - Wallets can be easily transferred between users by updating the Regular Signers Key
 - Adding a pointer from the XRP wallet to a decentralized data store aka IPFS is straight forward
 - XRP + IPFS allows an easily traceable path of ownership of an NFT and the original creator/artist
 - While a Wallet does require a 20 XRP funding minimum, future TXs are relatively inexpensive as compared to some other solutions
 - Having access to the Wallet allows for exciting features that are difficult to implement in a Token alone.
 - Some examples: Wallets can sign data
 - Wallets can receive and send payments.
 - Wallets using Xumm can authenticate to other services
 - Hooks
 - Xmpl.Cloud
